# CMake & pybind11 Project Template

Inspired by pybind11's official cmake template (https://github.com/pybind/cmake_example),
this project is intended to get you (and me) started with a C++ project
with a complex project structure and Python bindings using pybind11.

**This project has been tested only on Linux systems.**
